        <p>On this page I describe my experience of getting the DZ license in Ontario as a firefighter student. I was pointed to <a href="https://www.pinevalleydrivingacademy.ca/dz-license.html">Pine Valley Driving Academy</a> who informed me of how to get started.</p>

    <h2>Knowledge Test</h2>
    Both the D license and the Z airbrake endorsement require you to pass a multiple choice knowledge test first before you can begin practical lessons. You just show up to any DriveTest centre to take the knowledge test without booking anything! The wait times might be long so plan accordingly. Make sure to have a doctor fill out this <a href="https://nebula.wsimg.com/c698e219f548acec60e3eaef7345506f?AccessKeyId=FDE149271BD09FD17B76&disposition=0&alloworigin=1">medical form</a> for you as you need to bring this to DriveTest in order to take the knowledge tests.
    <h3>D: The Truck Part</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Truck handbook: <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/document/official-ministry-transportation-mto-truck-handbook">https://www.ontario.ca/document/official-ministry-transportation-mto-truck-handbook</a><ul>
            <li>Extremely dry and boring to read. But you <i>should</i> read it.</li>
            <li>When you read it, make sure to write down any <strong>numbers</strong> you see. The tests love those things. For example:<ul>
                <li>How many hours can you drive after x hours of driving and y hours off-duty? Memorize the hours of service requirements.</li>
                <li>What are the acceptable thresholds for air pressures in the brakes?</li>
                <li>What are the acceptable measurements for various inspection items?</li>
                <li>How many demerit points is given for certain behaviours? How long is the impoundment period for certain violations?</li>
            </ul>etc.!</li>
            <li>There's also a few truck-specific signs, they're not hard but just make sure to read them at least once! They made up of 3 of the 30 questions for me. Free marks.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Free practice tests I found online (some of them have class A stuff mixed in so you can just wing those since they're irrelevant):<ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.drivingtest.ca/ontario-truck-driver-licence-practice-test-class-a-d/">https://www.drivingtest.ca/ontario-truck-driver-licence-practice-test-class-a-d/</a></li>

        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Z: The Airbrake Part</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Honestly if you don't know anything about brakes or air brakes I'd strongly recommend watching a few short youtube videos on this "Smart Drive Test" channel (e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFi957GaxpU">this one</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMxilatT0qw">this one</a>) just to gain some intuition before reading the handbook.</li>
        <li>Airbrake handbook: <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/document/official-air-brake-handbook">https://www.ontario.ca/document/official-air-brake-handbook</a><ul>
            <li>Also extremely dry and boring to read. But you <i>should</i> read it.</li>
            <li>Same thing, memorize the **** out of any <strong>numbers</strong> you see in here.</li>
            <li>I hated the tractor-trailer section because it felt so irrelevant to me, but actually quite a lot of questions are on those.</li>
            <li>The inspections and tests are stupid long but if you know/understand what each component does then it's more digestible.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Free practice tests: <a href="https://www.drivingtest.ca/ontario-air-brake-z-endorsement-knowledge-test-practice/">https://www.drivingtest.ca/ontario-air-brake-z-endorsement-knowledge-test-practice/</a>.</li>
